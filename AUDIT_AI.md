# Security Audit Report for ProxyAuth
Date: 2025-05-11 04:14:31

---

## 1. 🔧 Configuration and Secret Management

- ✅ The `config.json` file stores users with Argon2 hashes: secure practice.
- ⚠️ `token_admin` and other secrets are stored in plaintext in config. Consider loading via environment variables.
- ✅ `.gitignore` is correctly configured to avoid leaking sensitive files.

**Recommendation**: Load sensitive data from environment variables and encrypt if persistent storage is needed.

---

## 2. 🔐 Token Management

- ✅ Tokens are generated using `ChaCha20Poly1305` with `HMAC-SHA256`, a strong combination.
- ✅ Tokens include a daily timestamp using `Utc::now()`, making the secret dynamic per day.
- ✅ Keys are derived from a combination of build time, random values, and time.

**Conclusion**: The token generation is secure and time-dependent, offering implicit rotation and protection.

---

## 3. 👤 Authentication

- ✅ Passwords are hashed using Argon2 with per-user salt.
- ✅ Users are managed via configuration files.
- ⚠️ No visible brute-force protection on failed login attempts.

**Recommendation**: Introduce lockout or exponential delay after several failed attempts.

---

## 4. 🔒 Cryptography

- ✅ Secure algorithms used: Argon2, HMAC-SHA256, ChaCha20.
- ✅ Dynamic secret generation based on time and entropy ensures per-day uniqueness.
- ✅ Uses `OsRng` for secure random salt generation.

**Conclusion**: Excellent cryptographic hygiene.

---

## 5. 🚫 Attack Mitigation

- ✅ `ratelimit.rs` implements request throttling.
- ✅ Supports various modes (`RATELIMITE_GLOBAL_ON`, etc).
- ⚠️ Could be bypassed if headers (like IP) are spoofed without HTTPS enforcement.
- ❌ Input validation (e.g., headers, user fields) not clearly enforced in `auth.rs`.

**Recommendation**: 
- Sanitize or whitelist incoming inputs.
- Consider additional middleware for input validation.

---

## 6. 🌐 Network & Proxy Security

- ✅ Reverse proxy logic is implemented (`proxy.rs`).
- ⚠️ Depends on `X-Auth-Token` headers which are vulnerable unless HTTPS is enforced.
- ❌ No hard enforcement of HTTPS is visible in the code.

**Recommendation**:
- Reject any non-HTTPS traffic (or rely on a front-facing NGINX).
- Restrict accepted source IPs if used on an internal network.

---

## 7. 🪵 Logging & Error Handling

- ✅ Logs are clean — no sensitive data (tokens, passwords, secrets) are written to logs.
- ✅ Uses `tracing` macros (`info!`, `warn!`, etc).

**Recommendation**: Never log tokens, secrets, or failed passwords — even in debug.

---

## 8. 📦 Dependency Security

- ✅ `Cargo.lock` is committed.
- ❌ No `cargo audit` usage in GitHub Actions workflows.
- ✅ Dependencies appear well-maintained.

**Recommendation**: Add `cargo audit` to CI to detect vulnerable crates automatically.

---

## 9. 🐳 Docker & CI/CD

- ✅ Docker runs under a non-root user (`proxyauth`).
- ⚠️ No security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options) in HTTP responses.
- ✅ CI workflows are clean and structured.

**Recommendation**:
- Consider adding security headers in all responses.
- Ensure containers are scanned for vulnerabilities before deployment.

## 10. ✅ Overall Summary

| Aspect              | Status     | Notes                                                       |
|---------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Authentication      | ✅ Good     | Argon2 with dynamic salt                                    |
| Tokens              | ✅ Secure   | HMAC + ChaCha with time-based entropy                       |
| Cryptography        | ✅ Excellent| Uses modern, safe primitives with daily key variation       |
| Ratelimit           | ✅ Enforced | Rate-limiting is in place                                   |
| Network             | ⚠️ Partial | Depends on external HTTPS enforcement                       |
| Logging             | ✅ Clean    | No sensitive data is present in logs                        |
| CI/Docker           | ✅ Secure   | Runs as non-root, well-structured Dockerfile                |
| Global Security     | ✅ Robust   | Great structure with small areas for improvement            |

If you address the few remaining risks (logging, HTTPS enforcement, brute-force), this project will reach an **excellent** security standard.
